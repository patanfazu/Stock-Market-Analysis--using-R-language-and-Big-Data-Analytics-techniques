# Stock-Market-Analysis--using-R-language-and-Big-Data-Analytics-techniques
The following project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of stock market components limited to the telecommunication sector. We take into account around 5 telecom companies like Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone Idea Ltd, Reliance Communications Ltd, Tata Communications Ltd, MTNL Ltd, and do a holistic evaluation of how they perform in the day-to-day share activities. Predicting future situations based on past trends is also something this analysis aims to achieve.

### The abstract contains the following questions which are expected to be answered in the projectâ€™s final submission:

1. Compare, contrast and check whether there is any correlation between the
BSE overall market and the telecommunication industry?
2. What might be the reason or situation behind the fall and rise that occurred
for 5 stocks?
3. Find the most common day of the week (Mon...to ..Sat.) where the
difference between the open and close price is high for stocks. Also, state the
reason for it?
4. Compare and find % gains if we invest among one of 5 stocks for a period of
1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years.
5. Based on the analysis of % gains and loss, what circumstances would be best
to sell or purchase stocks of these 5 companies?
